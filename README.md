# Numpy_panda_basics
 This repository will contain a basic guide book for numpy and pandas packages. Numpy and pandas are the two essential parts of a data analysis and data cleaning, both of which are critical prior to any deep learning projects. If you are coming from a non coding background, this notebook will help you get rolling in mastering some of the key aspects of your NN trainning projects. Use this as a cheatsheet. 
 I will be creating a jupyternote book for pandas, which will be published soon.
